            "content": "Zenit St. Petersburg duo Malcom and Claudinho intend to receive citizenship, officials have confirmed Brazilian footballers Malcom and Claudinho have asked for advice on receiving Russian citizenship, according to the pair\u2019s club, Zenit St. Petersburg. The duo are among the biggest-name foreign stars currently playing in Russia. \u201cMalcom and Claudinho, on their own initiative, want to obtain Russian citizenship,\u201d Zenit\u2019s press service confirmed to the Russian media on Monday. \u201cThey asked the club for advice on this issue. We have sent letters to the\u00a0RFU\u00a0(Russian Football Union) and the Russian Ministry of Sports.\u00a0Now we are waiting for an answer on how this is possible.\u201d Malcom, 25, joined Zenit from Spanish giants Barcelona in the summer of 2019, in a deal worth an initial \u20ac40 million ($40 million). \u00a0 Read more Big-name Brazilian star won\u2019t quit Russia His countryman Claudinho made the move to northern Russia last summer from Brazilian club Red Bull Bragantino for a reported fee of \u20ac15 million ($15 million). After a slow start to life in Russia, Malcom has found more consistent form, scoring eight times and contributing seven assists in Zenit\u2019s title-winning campaign last season. The winger has continued that form this season, scoring six times and providing six assists in ten Russian Premier League appearances as Zenit lead the table and search for a fifth successive title. Playmaker Claudinho, 25, hit the ground running upon his arrival in Russia and was named Russian Premier League player of the season for 2021/22 after netting eight times and laying on five assists in 23 appearances. The reasons for the pair\u2019s purported interest in obtaining Russian citizenship were not immediately clear. It was suggested by some in the Russian media that the motivation may be for tax purposes, although elsewhere it was pointed out that foreigners are considered tax residents in Russia if they spend more than 183 days a year in the country\u00a0\u2013 meaning they pay the same 13% personal income rate as nationals. Read more Russian clubs launch legal battle over \u2018discriminatory\u2019 FIFA policy \u2013 media There have also been claims that the reason could be a desire to play for the Russian national team. Malcom and Claudinho were both part of the Brazilian team which won gold at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, where Malcom scored the winning goal in the final. The Olympics, however, are not considered as an official event by FIFA and neither Malcom not Claudinho has made a senior appearance for their country. Current FIFA rules would provide hurdles for the players switching to Russia, which would likely involve a wait of several years for eligibility. The news of interest in Russian citizenship from Malcom and Claudinho also comes despite Russian teams currently being banned from all UEFA and FIFA competitions because of the conflict in Ukraine.\u00a0 That has resulted in Zenit being deprived of their place in the UEFA Champions League for the 2022/23 season, with uncertainty over when Russian teams might be welcomed back.\u00a0 Read more Russia World Cup hero breaks hearts with Brazil return Russia does have a history of naturalized citizens from Brazil who have starred for the national team. Lokomotiv Moscow goalkeeper Guilherme has been capped 19 times by Russia after gaining citizenship in 2015. The biggest Brazilian-born success for Russia is undoubtedly defender Mario Fernandes. The 32-year-old starred in Russia\u2019s 2018 World Cup run on home soil and famously scored a late equalizer against Croatia in the quarterfinals before suffering penalty shootout agony. Guilherme remains at Lokomotiv Moscow, while Fernandes returned to Brazil earlier this year, citing family reasons.",

Ukrainian-born father-of-two Viktor Yatsunyk, 44, died in a landmine explosion after returning to his native country to fight the Russian invaders. SuppliedBrit fighter Viktor Yatsunyk has been killed in Ukraine[/caption] SuppliedThe Ukrainian-born dad-of-two previously served as a reservist in the British Army[/caption] He was awarded a medal for bravery by the Ukrainian armySupplied He was killed on Saturday when he and some fellow soldiers went to evacuate their injured comrades on the frontline near the newly-liberated city of Izyum. Viktor, who lived in rural Oxfordshire, is believed to have spent four years as a reservist in the British Army before going to Ukraine. He first moved to the UK some 25 years ago, according to a close friend. Devastated Roman, 45, who didn\u2019t want to give his surname, told The Sun Online how his hero friend had shown bravery to the end.

This year, when Putin launched Russia\u2019s brutal invasion, Viktor, who had been a soldier in the British Army reservists, decided that he had to go and defend his country. \u201cViktor was a patriot,\u201d Roman said. \u201cHe told me, \u2018If we don\u2019t fight, who will fight for us?\u2019 He was an honest person who would help anyone, he had a good heart.\u201d In one of their final conversations before he left for Ukraine, Viktor asked Roman if he could pick up a bulletproof vest for him from an address in London. \u201cI saw him in Oxfordshire the day before he flew to Poland in March,\u201d Roman said. \u201cWe talked a lot when he was in Ukraine. He was a commander of a unit that went to rescue the injured. He was training Ukrainian soldiers.\u201d We were very close friends. He was like my brother RomanFriend, Viktor Yatsunyk Just weeks before his own tragic death, Roman said Viktor was lucky to survive after a Russian missile hit his squadron\u2019s position. A comrade just metres from him was killed. But Roman said Viktor was never scared and was even awarded a medal for bravery by the Ukrainian military. Even in his final message to Roman, Viktor was still focused entirely on the war efforts. \u201cHe wanted me to order him some parts for military drones,\u201d Roman said. \u201cThat was his last message to me.\u201d suppliedViktor during his time as a reservist in the British Army[/caption] SuppliedHe went to Ukraine to fight the Russian invaders in March[/caption] Viktor was killed by a landmine in Izyum on Saturday, just days after the city had been liberated from Russian forces. He was recovering some of his wounded comrades when he was killed. One landmine exploded, triggering a second mine to detonate. The blast was so powerful that the explosion killed one and wounded three other soldiers who were some 10 metres away, Roman added. Roman said Viktor\u2019s wife has flown out to Ukraine to collect his body, and his funeral is expected to be later this week. Viktor is the fourth British national known to have died since the start of the Ukraine war. In April, Brit dad\u00a0Scott Silbey was named as the first UK casualty in Ukraine.

            "content": "Two hundred and ten years ago, on September 15, 1812, the French Army led by Emperor Napoleon entered the Kremlin in Moscow. In the eyes of the world, it was all over \u2013 the largest city in Russia was lying prostrate at the feet of the world\u2019s greatest military supremo. In three months, however, what remained of Napoleon\u2019s army was fleeing \u2013 the corps and regiments mere shadows of their former selves. The huge forces that invaded Russia in the summer were all but destroyed by the end of the year; the exact losses are debated to this day, but the number of soldiers dead or captured is estimated to have been between 400,000 and 500,000. The classic Western narrative is that Napoleon had to retreat because of the Russian winter, his forces beaten down by the harsh climate. The standard Russian view is that Napoleon was met by a different natural force \u2013 patriotism, which drove ordinary people to take up arms against the French invaders, complementing the efforts of the regular army. Leo Tolstoy\u2019s account of the war contributed to this image, and it\u2019s hard to compete with the power of his literary genius. However, little was random or \u2018natural\u2019 in the defeat of Napoleon. First of all, it is hard to imagine that such a seasoned general had forgotten to consider the climate of the country he set out to conquer. In fact, Napoleon had already waged winter campaigns. The Battle of Austerlitz in 1805 was lost by the Russians under colder temperatures than the Battle of Berezina \u2013 where the Russians prevailed. Meanwhile, the Battle of Eylau, which ended inconclusively for both parties, occurred during heavy snowstorms. In other words, Napoleon was not some African chieftain who could be excused for never having seen snow in his life. The grassroots resistance story is also far from accurate. It wasn\u2019t the first time that Napoleon had to fight against a popular militia \u2013 in Spain, such forces played an auxiliary role to Wellington\u2019s regular corps, and the French Army wasn\u2019t destroyed so totally and swiftly. Russians themselves faced a guerrilla war in Finland during the Swedish campaign of 1808-09, when the winter was extremely harsh. But it did not stop the Russian offensive. In other words, neither snow nor mass resistance could guarantee the outcome, and certainly could not ensure the defeat of a massive army led by a brilliant general. The War of 1812 was unusual. At first, the French Army advanced and the Russian defenders pulled back. None of the battles could alter the course of the conflict. Napoleon then began to retreat, but the ensuing confrontations did not have any significant impact on the overall situation either. Napoleon kept going backwards after each one, and the Russians kept following his army. But the Russians were not simply reacting to a campaign that seemed to have its own internal logic \u2013 they had a detailed plan. The scheme had its roots in the failed campaigns of 1805 and 1806-07. After a series of humiliating defeats, Tsar Alexander I and Napoleon signed the Treaties of Tilsit. However, this peace deal did not resolve the conflict between the two countries, and everyone realized it was nothing more than a brief interlude. Napoleon was great at achieving tactical objectives, and this presented a problem. Also, up to that point, Russia had always been part of a coalition, including Austria and Prussia \u2013 but now they were under Napoleon\u2019s rule and were unable to help. This meant that the enemy would have a lot more troops, led by the great military commander. Nobody would have bet on the Russian Army under these circumstances. Therefore, it needed to come up with asymmetric measures. Using a sports analogy, the Russians had to drag Mike Tyson into a shooting tournament. By April 1812, this idea was developed into an action plan. Curiously, it was drawn up by a person who is not well known in present-day Russia. He was Lieutenant Colonel Pyotr Chuykevich, and he served in the War Ministry\u2019s Special Office, a secret department not many knew of. The Special Office was one of the pet projects of War Minister Michael Barclay de Tolly, a Russian prince and soldier of Baltic German and Scottish origin. Barclay de Tolly was a brilliant and successful commander, though his talents were in areas that do not usually bring military glory \u2013 he was great at organizing supply chains, logistics, and gathering intelligence. In other words, he was good at the things that are rarely noticed until they become the army\u2019s biggest weaknesses. Chuykevich was one of his appointees to the Special Office, which was, in fact, Russia\u2019s first official intelligence gathering agency. Chuykevich produced an analytical note titled \u2018Patriotic Thoughts\u2019, which was delivered to Barclay de Tolly. Having carefully studied the composition of the French Army and Napoleon\u2019s preferred strategy, the lieutenant colonel reasoned that the best way forward was to not let the French Army use its massive advantage in power. He suggested avoiding a general battle to spare Russia\u2019s troops, and retreating while conducting guerrilla warfare, especially in the rear of the enemy, in order to hit their supply lines and exhaust and weaken Napoleon\u2019s army to eventually gain the advantage. It was a sound plan. There were only two possibilities for the formidable French Army to obtain supplies: By having them delivered from Western Europe, or pillaging and foraging for them. Obviously, deliveries from the West would not be reliable due to the enormous and ever-growing distances the convoys would have to cover, as well as the appalling condition of the Russian roads. And if the French Army was betting on foraging for supplies locally, another problem arose. Since the population density in Russia was (and still is) much lower than in other parts of Europe, Napoleon\u2019s foraging missions had to travel far and wide in order to obtain enough provisions. And that is when they would run into a second problem. The Russians were creative in organizing partisan operations. In fact, this designation covered two distinct phenomena. On the one hand, there were regular detachments active in the rear of the French Army\u2019s operating line. They were led by officers and consisted of Cossacks, dragoons, hussars, and sometimes light infantry. They often had their own light artillery. These units carried out reconnaissance, destroyed foragers, and intercepted couriers. The French also had to deal with irregular units consisting of peasants who sought to prevent marauders and foragers from entering their villages. Many such units were headed by the local landlord, who would often be a retired military officer versed in the basics of military organization. They tried to recruit peasants who had some experience with weapons and outdoor living \u2013 hunters, whippers-in, foresters, and so on. These units communicated with each other using church bells. Naturally, armed peasants could do little against the French Army, but this was never expected of them \u2013 all they had to do was to alert the regular partisan forces. If the partisans failed to deter the enemy, the regular army came to the rescue. This arrangement was not ideal, but it worked much of the time. Within this paradigm, the main army forces had a peculiar role. They had to remain in Napoleon\u2019s sight, limiting his army\u2019s freedom and preventing it from straggling across a large distance or moving across the country freely. The Russian Army used this approach because being aware of its presence, the French could neither relax nor disperse. As a result, the French forces had not even finished their offensive when they began to starve. They were unable to obtain enough food, and couldn't send enough troops to protect communications because Napoleon needed a force capable of confronting the main Russian Army. In addition, the Russians were retreating ever further. The French were already hundreds of kilometers away from their bases and had to leave a lot of people in the rear to maintain order, while supplies from the West had dried up. The battle near the village of Borodino, which Mikhail Kutuzov \u2013 the commander-in-chief of the Russian forces \u2013 agreed to fight, was at odds with this logic. However, Kutuzov was a politician as well as a military leader. He realized that giving up Moscow without a major battle would be something Russian society would not forgive. Yet he was perfectly aware of the fact that the reasons for fighting were more political than military, so, after the first day of the battle failed to result in a decisive win for either side, instead of pressing on (which would only have led to the utter defeat of the battle-weary Russian Army), he retreated and surrendered Moscow to save the Russian forces. As a result, by entering Moscow, Napoleon grabbed the cheese in the mousetrap. The capital kept him stranded for several weeks. All that time, the French emperor was trying to negotiate for peace, but he failed. Those weeks put the Grand Arm\u00e9e on the brink of disaster. After a while, the French retreated. As they embarked on the long trek back home, the weather was fine and the horrors of the \u2018dreadful Russian winter\u2019 \u2013 which, in reality, turned out to be quite ordinary \u2013 were yet to come, but the army was already beginning to suffer from starvation. As the temperatures dropped below freezing, horses started dying, and some of them were slaughtered for food. No horses meant no cavalry, making the French vulnerable to Russian mobile cavalry units that were harassing Napoleon\u2019s army. The next steps taken by Field Marshal Kutuzov were predictable. He continued to send in fresh forces against the French rear guard, trying to avoid major clashes and keeping the French moving. The Russian troops were not immune to the cold either, and just like the French, they had stragglers and those who fell ill. However, while Russian soldiers could stay in nearby villages until they recovered, the Frenchmen either had to stay behind and be taken prisoner, or keep going until they developed complications. Once weakened, they became vulnerable to infection. One of the key things Kutuzov ordered his officers to do might not sound heroic, yet was practical. The Russians were deliberately targeting French stores of food. Thus, the defeat of General Jean-Pierre Augereau\u2019s brigade at the village of Lyakhovo by partisans was, in essence, a nice bonus in the hunt for supply depots. The French Army did not freeze to death, but it was starving, while the battles looked more like executions, as the Russians used artillery to disperse French units marching past them, without the need for general engagement. The French couldn\u2019t put up much of a fight anyway, as most of their horses had been eaten and their guns had been left behind. The wounded soldiers faced the same dilemma as the sick \u2013 either be dragged along with the risk of complications and infections, or be left at the mercy of the Russians \u2013 which was actually not a bad idea. Suffering from the cold and the hardships of the autumn and later winter pursuit, the Russian troops were not inclined to inflict even more pain on the captive Frenchmen. After most of Marshal Michel Ney\u2019s corps was destroyed near Krasny, survivors simply walked towards the Russian positions to ask where they could surrender. Their guns were taken away from them and they were sent to the campfires where Russian soldiers, who were just as cold and miserable, would give their prisoners vodka to feel a little warmer inside. This may seem surreal, but not to those who were on a march in sub-zero temperatures for days. One of the key elements of this \u2018choking\u2019 strategy was an operation undertaken by the small Army of the Danube led by Pavel Chichagov behind Napoleon\u2019s lines. These days, Chichagov is mostly remembered as the man who failed to close the trap and allowed what remained of the French Army to escape at the battle near the Berezina River. However, the most important part of Chichagov\u2019s operation was what did before, not during, the Battle of Berezina. Before he proceeded to try to ensnare Napoleon at the Berezina, Chichagov captured Minsk, the key supply depot of the French which held two million daily rations. He did not even have to be at the Berezina, as he had smashed the French Army\u2019s chances of surviving. Due to a personal conflict with Kutuzov and his ultimate failure to trap Napoleon, Chichagov was not hailed as a war hero; however, his main success was the battle against the supply lines. And that was the moment when the bitter cold really set in, killing people who were trudging westward across snow-covered plains and forests. But the weather was just the final nail in the Grand Arm\u00e9e\u2019s coffin, finishing off an army that had already been routed. For Russia, 1812 signified not just a great military triumph, but also the victory of intelligence and self-control over brute force. The Russians had a plan and stuck to it, while Tsar Alexander I was resolute enough to stay on course even after Napoleon captured the capital. The courage of the soldiers, the climate, and other obvious factors played a role, but the War of 1812 is, above all else, a triumph of strategy and consistency in pursuing goals.",
